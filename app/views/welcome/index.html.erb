              Since I know you'll forget to check, I'll lovingly provide you with accurate weather reports, right when you need it: before you leave the house. I don't want you to be cold just because you refuse to wear that sweater I got you for Christmas!

              You need to eat better! I'll send you information on nearby farmers markets and restuarants so that you can 'stay local' as you kids say.  Although I still don't get the big deal about 'organic food'.  It's so expensive!</small>

Just because you don't live here anymore and I don't hear from you as much as I should and you never wear any of the clothes that I buy you and I don't know what you've done with your hair and I think that person you're dating is completely wrong for you doesn't mean that I won't always love you!</small></p>
